sbt-notebook plugin
========

A sbt plugin that adds [notebook](https://github.com/ipython/ipython)
capabilities to sbt projects.

This plugin mainly adds a `notebook` task to your sbt project, that launches a scala-notebook server with your project build products and its dependencies on the classpath. You can think of it as a graphical in-browser `console`.

This is the [Jove](https://github.com/jove-sh/jove) branch of sbt-notebook.
